    <p>Hi everyone! Nice to meet you!
        I am a student, and I am taking up my major here, which is Applied Technology, and this is my 
        second semester. I am from the Philippines.</p>
    <p>What I like about myself is that I am a person who is not easy to 
        give up even though I face many challenges and obstacles in life, it may be in my education 
        journey or personal life because I know that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will always be there 
        for me no matter what. What I like to do, especially in my free time, is to read books or novels, watch 
        movies go to church for weekly activities, and spend time with my family.</p>
    <p>BYU Pathway Program and BYU-Idaho blessed my family and me so much because of the skills that I 
        have discovered that I was able to have a job and help my family. This course is what I am excited 
        about the most to learn because I am very interested in web designing, and I know that taking this 
        course will help me in many aspects of my dream career.</p>
    <p>That's all, thank you, and I am excited to get to know all of you!</p>
